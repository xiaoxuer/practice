1. three types of shared mem :
slru for clog 
wal buffer for xlog
shared buffer pool 

the way  postgres do the crash recovery, it will save three inform into pg_ctrl file. 
1. db status
2. checkpoint (when to do a check point is decided by engine), this will ensure all the data is persistent(write to disk) after this point. 
3. the previous checkpoint in case #2 has issue 
4. each transcation will generate multiple xlog, when commit happens, it will flush the xlog for this transaction to disk to ensure xlog is
persistent.
