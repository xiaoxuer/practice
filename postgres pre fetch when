1. sequential scan . always know the next block id 
2. secondary index 
this is based on the row number, have a list of blocks that is not continousely in number 



A secondary index is a data structure that contains a subset of attributes from a table,
along with an alternate key to support Query operations.
You can retrieve data from the index using a Query , in much the same way as you use Query with a table.
