1. why lock is needed for previous implementation
a. this is because parent xid & subtransaction xid stay on the same page, so if you want to make the transaction commit 
you need to lock the page , mark all of them , and then release the page . sub-commit only happens when the sub transaction xid 
located on a different page compare to parent xid 

b. allocated a new segment of clog only happens during xid allocation, which is already protected by a lock 

c. new design, to strip the clog id to avoid  hostspot issue . 
For subtrascation to check transaction commit status, it will look its parent transaction id 's status to determine whether to c
change the stage back

2. for porting clog from disk to grover, need to save the content of each 0003 0004 to the grover following the stripped version
as file over is expecting.
