1. why lock is needed for previous implementation
a. this is because parent xid & subtransaction xid stay on the same page, so if you want to make the transaction commit 
you need to lock the page , mark all of them , and then release the page . sub-commit only happens when the sub transaction xid 
located on a different page compare to parent xid 

b. allocated a new segment of clog only happens during xid allocation, which is already protected by a lock 

c. new design, to strip the clog id to avoid  hostspot issue . 
For subtrascation to check transaction commit status, it will look its parent transaction id 's status to determine whether to c
change the stage back
