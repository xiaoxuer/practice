1. xid allocation & vaccume
xid is allocated and garbage collected as a clock . 
there is a minimum xid, next xid and a vaccume point. 

clog will record all the transaction between vaccume point & next allocated xid 
currently postgres save it in /dataDir/pg_clog 

for manfred, we are going to convert 8k page to 8 1k page, and strip happened inside segement 
each segment has 256pages , so it is 256K. 

in memory clog is 

1. create a seg table, which has a pointer to 2M segement and a pool of free memory used for garbage collection 
2. need to look at importor tool 
to convert from original  postgres clog to apg_clog and

create in memory in python , and flush to /tmp and then call the python API to call the actual function in runtime to 
import src file to destination file in grover 

the offset in grover can be found using apg_clog name
