MVCC  snapshot  per sql statement 
set of rows
T1 : read from the state
recommitted 
again, in repeatable 

serializable commit , predict locking 
keep track of the rows you have tracked, not for read replicas

replay been different, on the read node, 



== 1.different isolation levels when talked about MVCC

implementation 
version object attached to the table 

how postgres implemented the MVCC : 

1.s_min & s_max time stamps , c_min , c_max , commit id .
2. between the single column, in the postgres to see those value
3. creation time of the row 
4. update rows will update the row in place , all sort
=====

1. transaction 

when create the snapshot, we use the mvcc to determine the visibity
no need to do the redo 

== depends on the type of MVCC 
1. hot standby
2. the postgres https://momjian.us/main/writings/pgsql/mvcc.pdf
page 12. key point here needs to be looked at


== postgres 
no need to do re-do
clog abort shows the transatction does not complete, there is a roll back .
