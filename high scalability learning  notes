- Separate database reads from writes. If you don't have a lot of RAM and you do reads and writes you get paging involved which can hang your system for seconds. 
- Try and make a read only database if you can.
- Denormalize data. If you have to fetch stuff from 20 different tables try and make one table that is just used for reading.
