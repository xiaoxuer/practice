1. hint bits & clog 

hint bits are associated with the tuple , xmin & xmax

insert will do transaction, and update clog when commit happens (not abort )

but this will not flush hint bits, only when select * from table, at this time, hint bits will be updated 
so if hint bits are set , no need to look for clog .
