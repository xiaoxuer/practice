thread interruption 

18.8 Thread Interruption
A thread that is in the WaitSleepJoin state can be interrupted by another thread which results in the former thread transitioning into the Running state. To interrupt a thread we call the thread member function interrupt() and then an exception of type thread_interrupted is thrown. We note that interrupt() only works when the thread is in the WaitSleepJoin state. If the thread never enters this state, you should call boost::this_thread::interruption_point() to specify a point where the thread can be interrupted.
The following function contains a defined interruption point:

is this only for letting the other thread to run ? 

very good explaination about how to set the proper pthread cancel steps
